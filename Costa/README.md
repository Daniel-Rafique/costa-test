# Whitbread Magento developer test
Just a simple test to get a configurable product with its attributes and child products

## Add the module to the app/code directory the run php bin/magento setup:upgrade

## Next run the compiler php bin/magento setup:di:compile

## Browse to the endpoint http://domain.com/V1/costa-test/products and you should see a list of products

### I've used sample product data which will load all of the products in the store
